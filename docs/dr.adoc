= Rapid7 InsightVM Console Disaster Recovery Plan

== 1. Backup Strategy

=== 1.1 VMware Snapshots
* Schedule daily VMware snapshots of the entire InsightVM console VM
* Configure snapshots to occur during off-peak hours (e.g., 2 AM local time)
* Maintain a rolling set of snapshots: 7 daily, 4 weekly, and 2 monthly

=== 1.2 Snapshot Management
* Automate the deletion of outdated snapshots to conserve storage
* Verify snapshot integrity weekly using VMware's built-in tools
* Document the snapshot schedule and retention policy

=== 1.3 Off-site Replication
* Replicate VM snapshots to a secure off-site location or cloud storage daily
* Encrypt data during transmission and at rest
* Test the retrieval process quarterly to ensure off-site backups are accessible

== 2. Documentation

=== 2.1 System Configuration
* Maintain an up-to-date document detailing:
** VM specifications (CPU, RAM, storage)
** Network configuration (IP addresses, DNS, firewall rules)
** InsightVM console version and patch level
** Critical custom settings and integrations

=== 2.2 Recovery Procedures
* Document step-by-step recovery procedures, including:
** Snapshot restoration process
** Network reconfiguration steps
** Service startup sequence
** Verification checklist

=== 2.3 Contact Information
* Maintain a current list of key personnel and their roles in the DR process
* Include contact details for Rapid7 support and any relevant vendors

== 3. Recovery Environment

=== 3.1 Development Environment
* Ensure the dev environment can support a full copy of the production InsightVM console
* Regularly update the dev environment to mirror production capabilities
* Maintain network isolation to prevent conflicts during testing and recovery

== 4. Testing and Maintenance

=== 4.1 Regular Testing
* Conduct full recovery tests quarterly using the dev environment
* Perform more frequent component-level tests (e.g., snapshot restoration) monthly

=== 4.2 Test Process
. Spin up a new VM in the dev environment
. Restore the latest production snapshot to this VM
. Reconfigure network settings for the dev environment
. Verify InsightVM console functionality and data integrity
. Test key features (scanning, reporting, user access)
. Document the time taken for each step and any issues encountered

=== 4.3 Continuous Improvement
* Update the DR plan based on test results and lessons learned
* Review and revise the plan bi-annually or after significant system changes

== 5. Disaster Recovery Procedure

=== 5.1 Disaster Declaration
* Define criteria for declaring a disaster (e.g., extended unplanned downtime, data corruption)
* Establish a clear chain of command for disaster declaration

=== 5.2 Recovery Steps
. Assess the situation and declare a disaster if criteria are met
. Assemble the DR team and assign roles
. Identify the most recent stable snapshot
. Provision a new VM in the recovery environment (dev or cloud)
. Restore the selected snapshot to the new VM
. Reconfigure network settings for the new environment
. Start InsightVM services in the correct sequence
. Verify system functionality and data integrity
. Update DNS/IP addressing to point to the recovered console
. Inform users and resume normal operations

=== 5.3 Post-Recovery Actions
* Conduct a root cause analysis of the disaster
* Update the DR plan based on the recovery experience
* Create a new baseline snapshot of the recovered system
* Schedule a team debrief to discuss the recovery process and identify improvements

== 6. Communication Plan

=== 6.1 Internal Communication
* Define communication channels for the DR team (e.g., dedicated Slack channel, conference bridge)
* Establish regular update intervals during the recovery process

=== 6.2 Stakeholder Communication
* Prepare message templates for different disaster scenarios
* Define the process for updating stakeholders on recovery progress
* Designate a team member responsible for external communications

== 7. Compliance and Security

=== 7.1 Data Protection
* Ensure all backups and snapshots are encrypted and access-controlled
* Verify that the recovery process maintains data integrity and confidentiality

=== 7.2 Compliance Requirements
* Document how the DR plan meets relevant compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)
* Include steps to verify compliance in the post-recovery checklist

== 8. Plan Maintenance

=== 8.1 Regular Reviews
* Schedule bi-annual reviews of the entire DR plan
* Assign responsibility for keeping the plan updated

=== 8.2 Change Management
* Implement a process to update the DR plan when there are significant changes to the InsightVM console or infrastructure
* Ensure all team members are notified and trained on plan updates
