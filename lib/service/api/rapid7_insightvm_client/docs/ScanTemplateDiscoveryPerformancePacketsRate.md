**defeat_rate_limit** | **BOOLEAN** | Whether defeat rate limit (defeat-rst-ratelimit) is enforced on the minimum packet setting, which can improve scan speed. If it is disabled, the minimum packet rate setting may be ignored when a target limits its rate of RST (reset) responses to a port scan. This can increase scan accuracy by preventing the scan from missing ports. Defaults to &#x60;true&#x60;. | [optional] 
**maximum** | **Integer** | The minimum number of packets to send each second during discovery attempts. Defaults to &#x60;0&#x60;. | [optional]
